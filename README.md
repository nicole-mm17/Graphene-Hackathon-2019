# Graphene Hackathon 2019

## LIGHTsafe: Cycling Made Safe 

16th - 17th November 2019

We designed and created a cycling jacket with LED indicators, a horn and proximity sensors that could be activated and controlled using actions on a wirelessly connected glove. The glove sensed hand gestures using printed graphene tracks.
